Tinkering Repository for small, individual code projects.

Note that not all of these programs/projects will be completed. Some are just small tests. Others are half-formed ideas. 

This is primarily to track personal progress.

Note: Many of these projects are lessons (semi-guided) or Projects (no guidance beyond specific requirements) from FreeCodeCamp.
